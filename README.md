# Covid_19_Predict_model

This Note provide how to create covid 19 prediction model and extra thing is also predict Normal and Viral Pneumonia.
also use full method use Transfer learning mean already trained on large dataset.

Dataset Provide on kaggle :  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset

also use opencv when image file read. bgr type read.

### 3 way to predict model
